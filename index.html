				Nobody in the middle.
			</h3>
			<p>
				Everything started after me, KesieV, and my girlfriend Bianca, both passionate gamers, read <a target="_blank" href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=510083">this</a> pretty famous post on NeoGAF about the role of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nintendo.com/nintendo-direct/">Nintendo Direct</a> in gaming journalism.
			</p>
			<p>
				That article, despite its focus is on gaming, depicts an idea I've always had about internet: it has the capabilities to give information from the original source but this practice is not as common as it should. Having first hand information is crucial for <i>making your own opinion about facts</i> instead of <i>making your own opinion about opinions</i>: you'll discover what's <i>right</i>, <i>wrong</i>, <i>fair</i> and <i>unfair</i> by yourself.
			</p>
			<p>
				Keeping this idea in mind, we started the opensourced project <a target="_blank" href="index-jstv.html">JSTV</a> that, thanks to some code and magic, can aggregate informations from various sources and show them in video/reel form, that sometime looks like a <i>train station display</i> or <i>a thematic TV channel</i>, mainly picking the idea of <i>Nintendo Direct</i> and extending that to any topic and source.
			</p>
			<p>
				But is there anything better that turning an idea to its source in order to test its effectiveness? So <b>Gamecora TV</b> was born: hundreds of hand-picked videogame official sources squeezed in a long and ever changing video in which <b>game developers, publishers and any kind of party broadcasts their first-hand news</b>. You'll see obscure and clever game developers, businessman from well known publishers, game screenshots and videos talking by itself. <b>Nobody in the middle</b>.
			</p>
			<h3>
				How it works
			</h3>
			<p>
				When your browser reaches <b>Gamecora TV</b>, it will randomly choose 50 news feeds from the <b>Gamecora TV</b> database every hour. Regardless the published date, the author, the genre or the relevance, it'll pick the original information, cut, sort and spread it in <b>different TV programs</b> and prepare a video for you. It'll also select some nice music by <i>Arnaldo Brenna</i>, our official musician. All you'll see will be some nerdy progress bar and a big play button. Hit it and start watching.
			</p>
			<h3>
				The TV programs
			</h3>
			<p>
				<b>Gamecora TV</b> offers a number of thematic TV shows, which goes on air randomly and with different lenght every time. Which you'll like?

				Credits and Kudos
			</h3>
			<p>
				<a target="_blank" href="index-jstv.html">JSTV</a>, the core of <b>Gamecora TV</b> was coded by me, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kesiev.com">KesieV</a>, with the valuable help of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, but it's quite obvious that it's just a square with some knobs without its database, intro and outro creativity, logos and site review. Well, everything that's not coding was made by <a target="_blank" href="http://something-white.blogspot.it">Bianca</a>, my girlfriend, with the help of <a target="_blank" href="http://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.libreoffice.org/download">LibreOffice</a> and a huge amount of effort and time. And, whenever we could work as a duo, everything should have some <i>creepy Daffy-Duck-Style beatbox</i> as background music without...
